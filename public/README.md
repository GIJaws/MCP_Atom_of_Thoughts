# AoT Visualization Server Static Files

This directory contains static files for the Atom of Thoughts visualization server.

The visualization interface is primarily served dynamically, but this directory can be used to add additional static assets like:

- Custom stylesheets
- JavaScript libraries
- Images
- Favicon
- Other static resources

These files will be automatically served by the Express server when the visualization feature is enabled.
