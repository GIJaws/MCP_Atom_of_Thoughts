# Implementation Summary: Single-Instance AoT

## Problem
Claude Desktop was starting multiple instances of the MCP server, causing port conflicts:
```
WebSocket server error: Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::8090
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Solution Architecture
The solution implements a multi-layered approach to prevent multiple server instances:

1. **Port Availability Detection**
   - Created `port-checker.ts` utility with functions to check if ports are in use and test connectivity
   - Used TCP socket operations to verify port status reliably

2. **Asynchronous Initialization**
   - Modified all server startup code to work asynchronously
   - Added proper sequencing and waiting between server starts
   - Implemented robust error handling throughout startup sequence

3. **Instance Detection & Reuse**
   - Added logic to detect if servers are already running
   - Added graceful exit when another instance is detected
   - Made the code resilient to handle cases where visualization is unavailable

4. **Error Resilience**
   - Modified WebSocket usage to be optional (using `?.` operator)
   - Added fallback behavior when servers fail to start
   - Improved error reporting and logging

## Key Files Modified

1. **`port-checker.ts`** (New)
   - Core utilities for port detection and checking

2. **`websocket-server.ts`**
   - Made WebSocket server initialization asynchronous
   - Added port checking before starting server
   - Added null-safety for server operations

3. **`index.ts`** (MCP Server)
   - Added port checking before starting
   - Added handling for existing MCP server instances
   - Made WebSocket usage optional with null checking

4. **`visualization-server.ts`**
   - Restructured for asynchronous initialization
   - Added port conflict detection
   - Added proper shutdown and cleanup

5. **`visualize.ts`**
   - Added port checking before startup
   - Added proper process termination when conflicts detected
   - Improved error handling

6. **`launcher.ts`**
   - Made process synchronization asynchronous
   - Added detection for existing server instances
   - Added better diagnostics and status messages

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: No more port conflicts or crashed servers due to multiple instances
2. **Efficiency**: Resources aren't wasted starting duplicate servers
3. **Clarity**: Clear error messages when issues occur
4. **Resilience**: System continues to work even if visualization is unavailable
5. **User Experience**: Seamless operation even when Claude Desktop starts multiple processes

## Testing Validation

The solution was tested with the following scenarios:

1. **Normal startup**: Ensures core functionality still works
2. **Multiple startups**: Verifies that duplicate servers aren't started
3. **Staggered startup**: Tests that servers properly connect to existing instances
4. **Forced conflicts**: Validates graceful handling when ports are truly unavailable
